# References for the Presentation Project

#### There are a few things you need to consider in the final presentation project:

- Choosing a topic for your team
- What is the goal of your project
- What is the framework for your code 
- Making up a demo for your project
- The possible improvements

And, some works done by the former students can be found in this Repo, just for your reference. :smiley: 

#### Keeping in mind:
- There are only two weeks for the project. So, don't be too ambitious! :smiling_imp:
- You actually have to follow the 90-90 rule!:joy: So, finish the simple tasks first, and leave the hardest for the last.
